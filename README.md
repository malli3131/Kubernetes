# Kubernetes
* Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
* It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.
* It was created at Google & open sourced.
* It was hosted by cloud native computing foundation (CNCF).

### Kubernetes Features:
* **Planet Scale** : Designed on the same principles that allows Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your ops team.
* **Never Outgrow:** Whether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.
* **Run K8s Anywhere:** Kubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.
* Automatic rollouts & rollbacks
* Strorage Orchestration
* Automatic bin packing
* IPv4 and IPv6 dual stack
* Self healing
* Service discovery & load balancing
* Secret and Configuration management
* Batch execution
* Horizontal Scaling
* Designed for extensibility



## Concepts:
* Overview:
  * It is containerized orchestration platform for deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
  * It has two main components:
    * Control plane
    * A set of machines called nodes
  * Kubernetes API: it allows us to query and manipulate state of objects in Kubernetes.
  * All communications with Kubernets through API server.
  * Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system.
  * Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster.
